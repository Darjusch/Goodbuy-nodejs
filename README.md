# Setup 

## In short: Clone the project and start it with Docker.

You need credentials to access the database which are not published on Github for security reasons,
write me a message requesting that credentials and i will send them to you.

If you are using Docker desktop use the following steps to start the project in the workingdirectory:
```
docker build -t nodeapi .
```
In Docker desktop press run image and *specify a Port* under optionoal settings! ( 8080 ).
